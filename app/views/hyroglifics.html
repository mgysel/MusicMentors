The decorated producer has been on his grind; notching up the accolades as one of FACT mag’s ’10 Drum & Bass Producers to watch in 2015’, headhunted for the prestigious Red Bull Academy, and heralded for his debut extended-player on Kasra’s Critical Music with the genre-bending ‘No Drama’ EP in summer 2015.</td>
